"""
The one-based major.minor.patch version.
The version numbering scheme loosely follows http://semver.org/.
The major version is incremented when a significant feature
set is introduced. The minor version is incremented when there
is a functionality change. The patch version is incremented when
there is a backward-compatible refactoring or bug fix. All major,
minor and patch version numbers begin at 1.
